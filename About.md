Hi, I have made a library on the functioning of Airlines Managment...

This project is a console-based Airlines Management System developed in C++, utilizing concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and modular design using user-defined libraries. It simulates real-world airline operations such as ticket booking, passenger records, flight schedules, and more.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate how C++ can be used to create a functional management system with clean structure and user interaction. Each feature is organized into reusable components for better maintainability and scalability.

ðŸ”§ Explore the code, try out the features, and feel free to contribute or suggest improvements!
